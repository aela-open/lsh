s11 it is no longer feasible or affordable to purchase the most capable multi mission platform and then limit its use to execute tailored mission areas or focus on specific threats as asymmetric threats continue to evolve so will traditional threats the navy must find affordable and adaptable ways to fill current and future warfighting gaps
s12 a capable ship which meets the requirements for which it was designed
s13 the ddg 1000 cannot perform area air defense specifically it cannot successfully employ the standard missile sm 2 sm 3 or sm 6 and is incapable of conducting ballistic missile defense although superior in littoral asw the ddg 1000 lower power sonar design is less effective in the blue water than ddg 51 capability ddg 1000s advanced gun system ags design provides enhanced naval fires support capability in the littorals with increased survivability however with the accelerated advancement of precision munitions and targeting excess fires capacity already exists from tactical aviation and organic usmc fires unfortunately the ddg 1000 design sacrifices capacity for increased capability in an area where navy already has and is projected to have sufficient capacity and capability
s14 for four weeks between may and june we had decc officers on 24 hour call in the field to respond to resident odour complaints and to monitor contributing factors such as location and wind
s15 during the course of our investigations we located one industry where the odour controls were not working correctly and we are now making sure that the company rectifies this
s16 both of these businesses are co operating with decc staff to help eliminate any potential contributions they may be making towards rutherfords odour issues and thats a very positive outcome
s17 we were able to analyse four samples from our odour capturing canisters used during the survey however none of these came from residential areas and with the exception of the samples obtained from hunter water corporations sewer system were in fact typical of busy roads
s18 based on the diversity of complaints both in odour types and location we knew that this would not be a simple matter of finding one single source instead it is most likely a combination of processes from a combination of industries
s19 hopefully by working with the industries in rutherford to ensure that the correct odour controls are in place we can eliminate the offensive smells as much as possible
s20 just notice your breath repeatedly constantly start with a few minutes do it regularly daily everyday no days off if you miss a day dont ruminate too much just pick it up and start again keeping it regular is very important it will bring order and a restfulness to your life off of the cushion as it were
s21 i would like to speak a moment about this concept of community as a meditator you are not alone you are not selfish because you take the time to notice your thoughts in fact you will come to see if you sit with any real regularity and commitment that your time sitting will alter maybe even transform your life with others in very beneficial harmonious ways i do not want to give you the impression that everything will be perfect and pleasant henceforward no this is not any humans reality that i have met and i have met the lowest and the highest of the caste no i just wanted to make certain that you heard the report from the front lines as it were that you are not alone ever never no how
s22 there is nothin like that crack of the bat at the park it is probably my favorite sound of the park its not the same on broadcast no matter what kind of system you put it through ambience echo cracker jacks i dont care if i ever get back
s23 yah i picked this white one up last year i wear it when i think they are going to win i wear the grey when they are destined to lose i think ill have to wear the grey one more
s24 so do you find you get more comments from people when you were either color
s25 yah definetly the white one gets more guys staring at me those boys sneer occasionally at the grey one but the white one is more noticeable much more piratey looking if they ever drop the price on em or do another one hey maybe you and viv could do one with maybe less quality ah but youd probably go in the other direction and line em with sensors well maybe all i am saying is they could take off as a weird trend
s26 exactly ok so what are your top ten fenway sounds today
s27 in no particular order no wait i think i can order them
s28 common ma can i get a coffee i am too old enough to drink
s29 hey braid what can you tell me about the whereabouts of a guy named rockrock ring any bells
s30 ya rockrock viv must have let on to you about the package i received the other day it was dropped in at her uncles place im not certain how anyone knew we were there but it was clearly for me for us and there was a picture the picture was of cocoa and me taken about a month ago
s31 compro what no we were just having a snack down by the harbor
s32 i mean anything technologically compromising like maybe how did that photo get taken without either of you knowing it was being taken that kind of compromising
s33 oh yah well since you put it that way yes very compromising
s34 oh in that instance yah i think i know who this rockrock person maybe
s35 police are of the opinion that although the options of avos and the like are being pursued it will not deter those persons residing in willow drive from harassing the couple
s36 police are fearful that the violence may get out of hand and the best way to avoid this is through relocation

s47 vet tenants more thoroughly and not use our area as a dumping ground for troublemakers
s48 but it wasnt like that for us last christmas when all my kids presents were broken or stolen and our house was damaged by fire
s49 we had been out on christmas day returning to find our house had been trashed
s50 we had been inside for only a few minutes before people began throwing bricks at the building
s51 i ran out with my 18 month old baby in my arms my other children following
s52 the taxi driver waiting for us was astonished at what was happening
s53 our families are all safe now and i want nothing from anybody
s54 but i feel i must speak up now or i will have it on my conscience forever if i keep quiet and someone is killed in willow drive
s55 living there can be a nightmare and i feel so sorry for people who still live with all those troubles
s56 i was targeted because i am against drugs so i became the worst person in the world to many people there
s57 no one in the street will talk to police because they are so frightened
s58 people are fighting all over the place and it is getting out of hand
s59 the department of housing is putting bad people in here without checking on their past history
s60 my idea of hell is being photographed so maybe we can consider this my therapy session but im really looking forward to seeing how the artists view me because hopefully theyll be kinder to me than i am on myself and thats part of the therapy
s61 ive been listening to carol on the radio for years but ive never seen her so this has been a great experience
s62 because when you listen to someone on the radio for quite some time you can get a preconceived idea of what the face on the end of that voice may look like
s63 one of the things that makes it okay is that as opposed to being photographed youre being captured by someone else the only view of a photograph is the one you put on it yourself so this is my opportunity to see what other people see
s64 also how often in life do you get to do something like this my reaction to the whole thing has been yes then no yes then no but its a great privilege i mean when was the last time someone rang up and said hey can i paint your head
s65 and for people who have life long self esteem problems i think something like this helps even if they turn you inside out and flip you on your head
s66 this is why i work in radio and not television
s67 participants involved in this activity can look back proudly on their achievements knowing that their contribution created ongoing benefit to their community through assisting with the presentation and profile of a major tourist attraction of the hunter
s68 get some training interact with other people and build their self esteem
s69 the gaol is a state icon and the work for the dole project has not only been good for the participants in terms of giving them useful trade skills but its made an enormous contribution to the site
s70 this course is slightly different its going to have a little more emphasis on problem solving and negotiation skills
s71 it will give men better skills and strategies for resolving conflict so it doesnt escalate into something else
s72 its for men in close domestic relationships through to men having problems in their workplace unemployed to professional people
s73 younger men are more open to it i think its happening slowly
s74 women are encouraged to talk about their feelings where men arent
s75 this workshop will help men to identify and acknowledge what their feelings are
s76 it was a bit of a surprise it just arrived
s77 its a difficult thing for disability business services to market to the community because were so diverse and the community dont really have an understanding of what we do
s78 the funding is a good recognition from the government that this is a worthwhile venture
s79 disability services like mai wel need to market themselves and sometimes they have a limited capacity to do so
s80 this is a one off grant to up their activity on the marketing side
s81 this of course will hopefully grow their business and provide greater opportunities for them to expand
s82 theres nothing more important in disability services than providing the challenge and opportunity to work in mainstream australia
s83 the staff are very excited about going in as are the residents and the families
s84 it brings us right up and into the 21st century
s85 benhome provides a wonderful service to the local community and this further enhances what theyre able to do
s86 all governments are appreciative of not for profit organisations like the one here helping to engage the local community in the financial support of these facilities
s87 there shouldnt be any greater priority for government than to take care of elderly australians those who have contributed so much to the development of the nation
s88 weve got a rapidly ageing population so governments generally are going to have to look in the future at investing more into aged care facilities
s89 weve got an intergenerational challenge ahead of us to support older australians
s90 it the care of elderly australians has to be a big focus theres no doubt that greater investments are required
s91 when i started here 11 years ago we didnt have a call for it
s92 about eight years ago it was identified and we put an eight bed unit in place
s93 hey how about you repay me by buyin me one of these cards
s94 yah yah he burst look see ive been payin down on this ted williams card for a couple years now all i need is another twenty two bucks and it mine sweet ted mister did you know he is last guy to hit over 400
s95 well yah of course i do everyone knows that ya little squirt is that why you want the card
s96 no i want the card cuz he is coming back and i want to get him to autograph it for me wouldnt that be something id be rich if i could get his autograph on his card
s97 well yah of course hes all frozen proper like out there in the desert or dessert alcor is the place its only a few miles from my grandparents place googled it anyway ted and his head are just waiting and when he is ready he is coming back and ill be right there when he walks out of the facility flashes blazing like the fourth of july me calm like i will ill be there and ill get him to sign the card so mister can you help me get the card step up man i wont tell your wife about this vi dame
s98 so do you know this rockrock person and what does the photo have to do with this
s99 ya see back in the day i worked a few non commercial stations in new york boston and middle america this guy sounds pretty familiar but the degredation of the tape is muckin with my memory its throwing me off a bit it could have been a very good friend of mine using an alias and the tape warble is weird too ya know the whole alias alternate name thing that is the norm these days with so many folk in the online world was pretty much confined to terrestrial broadcast radio back then of course way back to the dawn of broadcast radio there were stage names and ghost writers but with radio the first mass electronic media fake names or alias were really something different the alive quality the live broadcast nature of the medium coupled with the intimacy of the audio in the ear of the listener really shifted persona frontin to a whole new realm
s100 mr radio historia phila dr ya know could you just answer the question who is this guy
s101 blaaaah ok so do you have any idea wait check that question how about will you be able to figure out who and what and why this recording was dropped here i mean it was literally airmailed and was that an eno track followed by firesign
s102 well if that is me then why dont i remember
s103 coop you had a pretty tough time out in california didnt you
s104 well yah i suppose it was a tough year we flew and jumped a lot and i did hit the trees a few times more than i can ever remember doin in the past i think
s105 well yah i would say that at least four or five times a season someone now not always someone sitting in my seats but someone within a few seats gets hit usually you dont see the blood but usually you dont have someone wearing a white silk top to the game silk really shows off blood
s106 hey if you dont mind me asking braid how often do you sell your seats what you have had those season tickets for twenty or is it 30 years now
s107 actually coop i only sit in my seats if it is the playoffs i sell or give away the seats to every regular season game i clear at least seventy six thousand a year selling the seats
s108 yup it is a bit weahd but hey i actually prefer to stand and mill about during the game more action better people watching
s109 well ya coop i been here a long time paid my dues sat through hundreds of games of sorrow with the sox have paid well maybe not hundreds but tens of thousands for tickets over the years keeping the season tickets in the fold and now well i deserve to make some of it back whilst the pink hats and silk patrons pay the gs for the seats
s110 people watching indeed braid indeed get it while you can

s121 buddy can i have my antenna back im gettin a lot of echo
s122 coop look i gotta go check on my patrons see if the silk splattered one is ok theyre calling me down hey let me just give ya a tip stay out of the tree climbing and try and dig up some of your old airchecks they will probably remind and jog a lot of memories for you and help explain the package delivery
s123 you know where to find me and get rid of that wack snogue gear it cant be good for your rehab
s124 hes been on the lam for four years and we were initially told he fled to mexico
s125 from the information i got he was hiding keeping a very low profile
s126 weve seen evidence for this water ice before in observations by the mars odyssey orbiter and in disappearing chunks observed by phoenix last month but this is the first time martian water has been touched and tasted
s127 phoenix is healthy and the projections for solar power look good so we want to take full advantage of having this resource in one of the most interesting locations on mars
s128 were excited because surprises are where discoveries come from one surprise is how the soil is behaving the ice rich layers stick to the scoop when poised in the sun above the deck different from what we expected from all the mars simulation testing weve done that has presented challenges for delivering samples but were finding ways to work with it and were gathering lots of information to help us understand this soil
s129 its a 30 watt light bulb giving us a laser show on mars
s130 the details and patterns we see in the ground show an ice dominated terrain as far as the eye can see
s131 they help us plan measurements were making within reach of the robotic arm and interpret those measurements on a wider scale
s132 ahh you know how it goes just lookin but thanks doll
s133 you know i hear that hundreds of times a day but
s134 she has a yankees tattoo she has a yankees tattoo
s135 ding ding you win that sure is funny way to tell a lady you like her new tattoo
s136 well actually viv i dont like your tattoo nope not one bit well may nah i dont really care for tattoos especially ones located their girlfriend that is just too obvious
s137 oh right i understand your one of them classy joes
s138 what in the hell are you doing with the beyond yesterday primitivistic shite
s139 well big boy gimme a chance and lets find out together
s140 you aint seen but half of it and you clearly
s141 wow i did not think you were going in that direction ever going to ever do that
s142 yah im full of surprises and empty of inhibition hey i never thought youd get that freakish implant either coop so you goin to the game you meeting braid
s143 hell be there he wouldnt miss it i mean hey is cocoa with you coop i been hearing some stuff about a package a blimp some stuff
s144 great thatll be swell then i really need to talk with him
s145 the japanese who show up here actually buy the regular stuff its the college kids that tend to buy the japanese language stuff
s146 but i we will be there no earlier than midnight viv
s147 swell coop your a genius in research well have a real nice or maybe not so nice
s148 morning hopefully youll get to the bottom of this mystery
s149 we are committed to ensuring that the products that come into america are safe for consumers and that the regulating agencies have what they need in order to do their job
s150 we still have a few concerns but not enough that would keep us from signing the bill
s151 so the president will sign that as soon as they can get it to us
s152 i have a responsibility to ensure that our state has enough money to pay its bills this is not an action that i take lightly
s153 i have nothing to eat son i have been sleeping without food for days
s154 hope is the power that gives us the power to step out and try
s155 do you think i ever woke up in the morning surveyed my apartment and said maybe ill crank the tunes and jump on my couch for a while i dont think so
s156 amazing wonderful and in most cases untrue stories about myself
s157 a prototypical child of the electronic age he knows how to use the sound bite he will give you a sentence that will be tailored for you to put into your news broadcast he is a child of the age in that sense
s158 this path im on now is only something i arrived at after having fully explored my own dickiness
s159 why certain undisclosed charities would give money to pay overhead for what is essentially a charitable conduit
s160 williams insists that whenever a person gives money for a particular charity 100 per of that money gets to the named beneficiary that may be true but it does not mitigate the fact that the vast majority of the overall money collected during 2006 went to administration
s161 we charge nothing for donations collected online and even cover the credit card costs associated with each donation we rely on the support of generous donors and advertisers to provide this service
s162 we have a responsibility to scrutinize all charitable endeavours to ensure that we are getting decent value for our dollar
s163 the point of this letter is to emphasize both the general and specific importance of all of us making the effort to sign up so that our organs may be used after our death by others for whom they can be the gift of life and for the extra courageous and hearty there are organ and bodily donations that can happen while we are alive many people wait on lists desperately hoping for this miracle and any of us may find ourselves or a close loved one in need at some point in ourlives the sad fact is that a small fraction of the population has signed up to make such donations possible at least by the laws in bc without that few moments of paperwork our body parts will simply go to the grave or crematorium that follows and sign up asap if you live in another jurisdiction take a few minutes and find out how you can do the same consider forwarding this email to your friends your facebook site your network post on your blog or however you prefer lets create a wave of donors
s164 hey it looks like this package is somehow attached to the dog
s165 this package that you dragged me out to see it has this weird filament attached to it and it is attached to the dog
s166 hey this stringy stuff is really weird its like really super strong and almost feels like silk hey did spiderman drop this package off or something
s167 censorship is anathema to the very spirit of the olympic games which celebrates diversity emphasizes mutual respect and demands dispassionate unadulterated representation of each competition
s168 china had promised to provide media covering the games with the same access and freedoms enjoyed at all other olympic games
s169 the ioc cannot sacrifice the olympic ideals in the name of harmony with its host city
s170 a lot of the money raised by givemeaning ends in my pocket
s171 i have stumbled from one business and personal failure to another
s172 the problem with the bible is that its had too many wikipedia edits
s173 indeed i did young man wow it was a classic really still to this day one of the best comebacks ever
s174 you know i remember watchin the game back in the early summer of 08 and it was just devastating couldnt believe it i was there sittin behind and beside jack and he was just so damn quiet damn quiet and arms folded steaming i mean he was having his usual crackin time at the game but he was beside himself by the time the laker had lost their 24 point lead in the forth quarter lost the lead in their own house their own court jacks own hardwood drinkin bottled water i thought hed pull his barker out and start shootin up the joint
s175 hey uncle ank would you like any coffee or juice this morning
s176 aaah ok doll ill have some of that pomegran night and cranberry
s177 ya pomegran night and cranberry man that ray allen he played the entire game that game and and he had one of the most beautiful smooth as pond ice isolation driving layups at the end of the game to totally empty la just gorgeous the iso started above the three point line so it really looked like hollywood movie type play unfortunately for la they cast the wrong guy to play one on one with in that game ray allen smooth
s178 ok here is your juice ank so coop do you remember the game anks talkin about
s179 well i remember the story celtics come back from a 20 something deficit in la in game four ray allen plays all 48 posey and house have huge contributions pierce and garnet their usual great and strong selves another amazing celtics lakers playoff game
s180 oh come on coop it was not just another amazing playoff game
s181 did you just say you were a competitive yoga fan cocoa
s182 har har you were listening to me hey ank one of coops associated parachuted this package in this mornin and we are just dying to listen to this weird tape that came along with it do you mind
s183 oh right right sorry to have interrupted kids ill take my juice and zilla and go see how the espalier are coming in
s184 i asked as i adjusted the cart in the slot
s185 said cocoa as she opened the silken wrap around her hips and let the sun shine in as we prepared to finally listen
s186 yah i just found it looks kinda interesting and familiar
s187 hey is that marblehead maybe around singing beach or is that
s188 hey i know who and where that picture was taken
s189 that photo you are cradling in your skimpily laced lap is
s190 so coop which associate of yours would parachute a package to you on a sunday
s191 well i know of a lot of people who would fancy the idea but those folks would be more interested in dropping bombs or incendiary devices which i guess could still be inside the package but there is only one person who would fashion a parachute from old radio station banners and drop it a total radio monkey but that person is dead or so i thought
s192 yah lets open that after we get the food on the table i could kill for a plate of our eggs bacon and the asparagus what we have been waiting for for over what has it been two years three to eat from our own patch the package can wait a bit cant it
s193 oh sure coop im not hungry anyway but you do look a bit pale you sure you ok that was quite a fall how is the new leg and ankle holding up
s194 ok so can we now open that package that has been staring at me this whole dang breakfast
s195 so coop is that it just a strange mix of shredded stuff
s196 well that my lovely is a honest to goodness radio cart machine
s197 a cart machine is a specialized auto cue quarter inch tape playing machine commonly used in radio broadcasting through the dawn of computer digital playing mechanisms
s198 woe spock that is quite enough fine i get it so who and why would someone send you this thing
s199 well i was known by some folk to have an uncommon love for the things
s200 ok so coop honey why would someone send you one
s201 just look at this thing it weighs about ten pounds it has real plastic buttons and it smells like a cybernetic dinosaur nice oil i bet this is pure marvelous oil in some ways these machines remind me of my 3g iphone
s202 coop look my power points are getting burnt out here with all the uv today i just need to know if you need any help with anything else im about done hearing about the cart machine as it will be a while until you clue me into what led caused or who did this parachute drop thing you can unravel your package yourself unravel your package hey actually i think your own package may be getting burned out here too your kimono is a bit loose hon
s203 would you look at the heads on this deck they are in good shape i wonder
s204 umm ok why i didnt fall that hard really hey this cart machine is actually attached to a battery powered supply already and here is a cartridge
s205 i do believe this is important that we dont make what is already a crowded and difficult environment for the traveling public and flight attendants
s206 you are trying to legislate courtesy folks and that just doesnt work
s207 it s easy to use and it offers a lot of applications
s208 i can t wait to actually see it in use in the field
s209 the real beauty of it is that the technology has been designed so that anyone who hasn t had any training on it can use it
s210 the government of japan believes that stringent measures taken to relieve the two officers showed a serious stance from the u s side in regards to the fire
s211 the government of japan understands that the navys investigation was conducted professionally and objectively
s212 we are stunned and cant help feeling shivers going down our spines
s213 for local stuff i dont drive as much ill get on a train
s214 ill take the free garrison bus from panzer casern to patch barracks to do grocery shopping
s215 my kids take the bus whenever they need to go to the hub a teen hangout at patch barracks or to a movie
s216 you do quite a bit of driving when you live out here
s217 i havent noticed us cutting down we have a hybrid for our other car and that helps
s218 well never see 2 a gallon again id be happy to see 3
s219 by pricing gas using a market based system were able to be more consistent with gas prices

s231 we will make every effort to ensure the surcharge is the amount required to cover overhead costs nothing more nothing less
s232 and if they thought there was any profit theyd be on us like a ton of bricks
s233 we are purchasing the fuel in euros and the overhead costs often are paid in euros
s234 please take into consideration whilst the price of oil increases the purchasing value of the dollar has decreased 37 percent in five years on our side had the dollar remained as it were five years ago we would be paying 37 percent less

s247 if i knew then what i know now i cant say for sure i would have reported it
s248 we keep thinking that the dod would get it by now but they dont
s249 were looking at about a 2 billion price tag for relocation and building an entirely new line
s250 if you add more train miles to a route for the railroad youll make trucking more attractive than railroad service so if thats the case youll have more trucks on the roads and people dont want to see that
s251 this was a pretty serious safety issue that we are going to correct
s252 loss of confidence in his ability to command and his failure to meet mission requirements and readiness standards
s253 we found cigarette butts where we shouldnt have found them
s254 the fire and the subsequent magnitude of the fire were the result of a series of human acts that could have been prevented
s255 so nobody really thinks that bush or mccain have a real answer for the challenges we face so what theyre going to try to do is make you scared of me you know hes not patriotic enough hes got a funny name you know he doesnt look like all those other presidents on those dollar bills you know hes risky thats essentially the argument theyre making
s256 americans want a respectful campaign people say negative ads move numbers they may but do we have to go to the lowest common denominator i dont think so
s257 we need to provide ore to the construction side of the operation to then commission the plant
s258 we shouldve by now already started that process but because of the delay in terms of relocating the power diversion around this property we now are out of kilter with what it is we should be doing in preparation for the mining
s259 it is wonderful to see many grape varieties collecting medals indicating the region can produce wine that is as good as any in australia
s260 i congratulate peter and anne jeffery of spring ridge on their trophy for the best chardonnay of the show which has consolidated cowras position as one of the top chardonnay regions in australia
s261 the best local wine of the show went to a shiraz and silver medals were won by viognier and semillon among the bronze medals we had a merlot cabernet sauvignon chardonnay shiraz shiraz viognier verdelho and a chardonnay semillon blend
s262 bathurst forming a menshed in bathurst is a good idea
s263 we have seen our membership jump from 30 members to 80 and many have formed great friendships
s264 we would like to see the youth come here and we could teach them how to build and create things we are looking to do an outreach course with tafe so people can learn how to use computers and we may have work for the dole people come here as well
s265 you can really see the progression the involvement and desire by the members to help young people is just fantastic and almost seems like a natural thing for groups like menshed to do
s266 we have received several grants and some of that money will be used to purchase new computers
s267 while its hot and dry the water supply level is very solid
s268 most people dont realize the impact cattle has on the state economy
s269 its the largest agricultural industry in the state and right now theres a rise in ranchers who feel they need to cut their losses
s270 he told me he hadnt played offensive line since middle school i tell you what junior guard nick charles and a couple of those older kids have done a good job just kind of crash coursing him
s271 he can move and he can bend and hes aggressive
s272 it gives him a little bit better chance to play
s273 i just dont think you can have a bunch of quarterbacks i think youve got to pick who your top two or three are and those are the guys you need
s274 weve got a lot of young guys so theres going to be a lot of anticipation a lot of guys ready to step up and play
s275 so theres definitely a lot of emotion going around so thats good
s276 this group will have a great work ethic and this group will have a great spirit about it
s277 now what weve got to do is get to the point where we play well
s278 this time last year we had a lot of them that were absolutely clueless because everything was new
s279 just the difference a year makes in the system were light years from where we were terminology wise and mentally
s280 youre able to get into a lot more detail sooner
s281 last year you were just trying to teach them the big picture where at least now theyve got a little bit of a grasp of it and you can be a little more thorough
s282 i want to make sure that were getting guys that you feel like really have a strong chance to be good players here
s283 and i think each guy gets more repetitions each guy gets more teaching each guy gets more coaching
s284 once we do put the bolts on the helmets if a guy hasnt earned them then hell be a bald falcon
s285 the lighthouse and pier reflect and celebrate the long and storied history of lake champlain and the people who lived and worked on its waters and along its shores
s286 we apologize for the inconvenience but are confident people will be very pleased when these facilities are restored to their previous grandeur and functionality
s287 forget it lavanya she doesnt know he is leaving today

s290 ohh its just my mobile i threw on the niks bed

s297 i remember when bernard hopkins was challenging me and at that time i was a welterweight and he was fighting as a light heavyweight and he called me out
s298 as a fighter i felt i had to challenge him so i did now manny pacquiao is challenging me and i am definitely considering it
s299 we were watching an espn 2 show a few weeks ago and they mentioned that brian minto amp kevin johnson were two of the top five american heavyweights but eddies name wasnt on the list come on now minto couldnt hit eddie with a handful of rice
s300 i started bernard hopkins and i managed former super middleweight champion steve little and eddie has more natural talent than anyone i have managed
s301 i see guys like ruiz valuev toney amp barrett getting opportunity after opportunity and that shuts out guys like me who lost one fight that i know i could have and should have won
s302 james is a very fan friendly fighter whose body attack alone makes him entertaining every time out his vast wealth of amateur experience provides a solid foundation for him hes the type of fighter who adds value to every card he appears on
s303 i love his body punching when you combine that with his tenacity in the ring it is hard to imagine him ever being in a bad fight
s304 that shows me that james is a real fighter i hope to do lots more fights with him in the future he was willing to get right back on the horse against a guy who is not a pitty pat opponent
s305 james is a very rugged and crowd pleasing fighter he sells a lot of tickets and has a lot of enthusiastic fans he generates excitement
s306 theres no doubt that james can come back and be a world champion someday hes very strong willed and has a ton of guts and determination ill be rooting for him hes a dynamite fighter and a great guy
s307 this time last year i was supposed to be fighting a legitimate ex champ in kassim ouma on a pay per view undercard
s308 that fight got cancelled but this time im in against a more respected ex champ in vernon forrest a future hall of famer and our fight is the co feature so its an even bigger fight
s309 this time around were fighting on my side of the tracks which means ill come with more aggression and more machismo i know vernon will come with more hunger but im a young hungry undefeated champion now and im going to stay that way
s310 he fought a great fight but he fought a vernon forrest who was at 45
s311 i had a bad night that night i had a terrible night the worst of my career it was like i was fighting in quicksand but on sept 13th mora will fight the vernon forrest he expected in june ill be at 100
s312 everyone who faces me says that the truth is that i have a difficult style and they find that out first hand when they fight me
s313 all his style did was make for an ugly stinky fight to watch and it was even more ugly to participate in it takes two to make a good fight and i couldnt give anything to make it a good fight i felt like i stunk out the joint that night
s314 its a misconception that i got old or that i took him lightly
s315 this time ill limit how much ill train for the fight
s316 i could have done more in the first fight because i knew what he was going to do its just that physically i couldnt adapt to what he did after four rounds i had nothing
s317 hes a master at holding without the referee seeing he holds and he tries to headbutt and elbow on his way in he even kneed me in the chest during one clinch thats why i hit him behind the head so i could draw attention from the ref vernon knows every trick in the book
s318 i think its going to be a more exciting fight this time
s319 i see in his eyes that i hurt his pride by beating him
s320 im going to be more aggressive im going to throw more right hands and go to the body im not going to hold back like i did the first time its mexican independence day weekend so i dont mind being a little macho or spilling a little blood
s321 i knew it was going to happen the eventual stoppage of cotto ive sparred with margarito for years sometimes he has good days sometimes i have good days but its always a war with him
s322 i remember the first time i sparred with him was in 1999 in oscar de la hoyas camp for ike quartey
s323 its been our goal to continue to bring exciting las vegas style boxing to this area since the beginning five years ago we have worked tirelessly to entertain the great boxing fans of this area by putting together some of the most exciting fights out there this saturday will be a culmination of all the hard work we have put forth these past five years we are going to pay our respects to the past of one in a million and look towards the future
s324 she knows about it people have told her but she hasnt seen it and she doesnt plan to
s325 shes on tour with benji madden and isnt watching television and has not been on the internet
s326 but shes already said shes not too happy about it
s327 i have fought some rough and tough fighters but hes the dirtiest fighter there is
s328 there was no way he was gonna beat me anyway
s329 i was too smart too fast too experienced if i kept on hitting him i would have killed him

s423 everybody sees china as this monster polluter but it is doing so much more than that
s424 china is already leading in certain types of technologies in the power sector it is in clean coal solar wind in transport it is developing more efficient compact cars and electric cars
s425 developed countries really need to demonstrate their sincerity demonstrate the feasibility of the solutions really demonstrate that they are serious about this
s426 telling developing countries that they must do it when they themselves are not is just not acceptable
s427 in china the top leadership are all of the same mindset china opened up 30 years ago but our economic miracle was driven by intense resource use that produced great pollution and recently unrest
s428 that is fully understood the leadership has been thinking about a new pathway they know they cant repeat the path of the past they know it has to be clean it has to be more efficient low carbon has now been integrated into this new pathway

s463 you know hes not patriotic enough hes got a funny name you know he doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
s464 barack obama has played the race card and he played it from the bottom of the deck its divisive negative shameful and wrong
s465 he can inspire the country to greatness this tomfoolery needs to stop
s466 because we have research and development expertise and focus on 10 disease states

s470 ill vote for obama because we need a democrat in the white house
s471 the best way that we can stand up for you is to make sure we have a democratic president taking the oath of office on jan 20 2009
s472 seen his passion his determination his grace and his grit
s473 there are a lot of folks still on the sidelines trying to make up their minds
s474 if were going to have a president that respects unions
s475 theres quite a few of us on the fence im not the only one a lot of her supporters are there
s476 right now obama is saying shes low on the list well decide what to do if he doesnt choose her
s477 i was thinking she would win and she slid back and i was really disappointed
s478 i definitely want to see a democrat in the white house
s479 he wasnt my first choice but thats the choice now
s480 she stood strong and tall and im glad shes supporting barack obama
s481 she has integrity and shes a lady of her word

s490 we both love her dearly and have only her best interests and well being in our hearts i ask you now please please bring snooks back
s491 there has to be a better way for us to solve our differences than this way
s492 we didnt have a lot of time to get it done so it tends to move a lot faster the last 24 hours i was surprised they obviously had a need for another bat in their lineup and a need for another outfielder i know white sox gm kenny williams had interest in junior in the past and looked at this as a good opportunity to add him to his club
s493 he thought about it and said he wanted to talk to his family about it i think its a very good opportunity for him they obviously wanted him pursued him and came after him thats got to be a good feeling for him i guess
s494 it was a lot more brief than i thought it was going to be
s495 it was kind of shocking all of sudden bam it was done he is still going to be a friend of mine im upset that hes leaving but its a good situation for him he wants to win a ring the white sox are in first place and he has a chance
s496 he wasnt having his best year but he was just getting hot
s497 you wont be able to fill those shoes no one is ken griffey jr its the end of an era in cincinnati he got hurt a lot but was one of the top five best to ever step on the field
s498 hes one of the best four or five hitters in baseball
s499 i like him yet he marches to his own drummer i had him in the all star game it doesnt make sense to me that he would be available
s500 we had some things that we were looking at that we were trying to improve mainly with the pen and we did that with rhodes
s501 we were trying to add catching depth and we banged on i think every door if we didnt its our fault as far as any other opportunities yes there were other opportunities that we wanted to explore because we like to be active with the minutes ticking we wanted to take advantage of it why some of those things didnt come to fruition could be a number of factors it could be the money the players to somebody else had different goals than we did
s502 we had conversations that went right down to the wire
s503 and whenever you have that obviously you feel like theres a chance but it takes two teams and by definition trades are difficult to make and weve worked extremely hard the last couple of weeks to try and find a pick and improve the team but at the end of the day we didnt find something that lined up for us
s504 i know there was a lot out there the way we view that is that the trade deadline is an opportunity for us to examine ways to improve our club we did that we had a lot of discussions a few of them led right up to the deadline but obviously nothing came to fruition
s505 we exchanged proposals in a couple of instances but nothing to the point were i was calling owner tom hicks for the final signoff
s506 the last four or five days obviously weve been in a lot of discussions and a lot of meetings and talked over a lot of different scenarios
s507 but we were never real close to what i would call making a deal
s508 tell you one thing and behind your back they do another thing
s509 for the first time we may have a highly useful model of postpartum depression
s510 the new research also points to a specific potential new target in the brain for medications to treat this disorder that affects 15 percent of women after they give birth
s511 after giving birth female mice deficient in the suspect protein showed depression like behaviors and neglected their newborn pups
s512 giving a drug that restored the proteins function improved maternal behavior and reduced pup mortality
s513 improper functioning of the delta subunit could impair the gaba systems ability to adapt to hormone fluctuations during the highly vulnerable post partum period
s514 targeting this subunit might be a promising strategy in developing new treatments for postpartum depression
s515 were eating this same produce in mexico and we havent had any problems
s516 reuters is carrying an article about a recent mit development which may pave the way for solar energy to be collected for use in low input periods
s517 with our catalyst almost 100 percent of the current used for electrolysis goes into making oxygen and hydrogen
s518 though until i hear a confirmation of mits findings from another university respected source i hold on to my severe doubts about this
s519 with our catalyst almost 100 percent of the current used for electrolysis goes into making oxygen and hydrogen
s520 noceras catalyst is made from cobalt phosphate and an electrode that produces oxygen from water by using 90 percent less electricity than current methods which use the costly metal platinum
s521 its always a tough decision when you leave an organization like detroit
s522 it was a wonderful ride for 15 years i spoke with all the people i worked with including the ownership and they understand the situation is an opportunity to come to chicago to be with stan
s523 when i first started with the blackhawks it was in the back of my mind but i kind of set it aside and wanted to go about and get my career in motion
s524 the free agent signings of the blackhawks caught my attention but you also have to develop your own players
s525 i can be another set of eyes for dale and denny and the organization
s526 with the outdoor game against detroit everything kind of goes together
s527 im really looking forward to getting this thing to where it should be
s528 look hes doing well and i have done well in the past
s529 this year was hard i guess with the start of the year but nevertheless i still think its been a good year i just hope i can show it now at the olympics and the u s open
s530 im looking forward for the next two tournaments those are really the ones that can make this season from a good one to a great one again
s531 i already played against him six times and it was always close so i knew that im going to have a chance today
s532 i dont think american tennis is troubled by any means but the way it is right now the best players in the world are from switzerland and spain
s533 to be honest i didnt think that it would happen in this tournament because last week i played really bad
s534 and i was injured before so i didnt do nothing basically for two weeks
s535 its tough to beat a guy like that with a second serve
s536 we believe the case will be solved if we can find this man
s537 even if they arrest me what could they charge me with they have been on a month long fishing expedition and not caught any fish
s538 i dont expect this case to be solved any time soon
s539 with full support from azizah as well as the pas and dap leadership and our friends in permatang pauh i am offering myself as an mp for the constituency
s540 actually selangor menteri besar tan sri khalid ibrahim had offered bandar tun razak so did azmin ali with his gombak seat they are all safe seats including the one in kulim
s541 if it looks very safe please convey that to umno
s542 where hydro power is concerned zambia has a lot of potential as for biofuels there are several types of crops that can be turned into fuel
s543 we have found zambia to have potential it has political stability and leadership that is committed and farsighted it also has a wealth of resources
s544 i believe there is a good opportunity for malaysia to be involved in zambias growth
s545 there are several major projects to be implemented in zambia first of all the government wants to make lusaka a cargo hub it also wants to build an inland port and a transportation corridor linking the country with major ports in africa
s546 there is also the plan for a multi functional trade zone this trade zone will not only have factories but also research and development facilities
s547 the investigation papers have been submitted to the chambers for further action but i do not know the contents
s548 no doubt i am the minister in charge but i am not in the habit of finding out the contents because that is not my job
s549 let the due processes take place under the law anwar is innocent until proven guilty
s550 there should be no talk about charges or him being arrested
s551 the police have completed their investigations and the papers have been submitted
s552 it is up to the chambers to decide whether to press charges against him or not
s553 conducting a trial for the public to make a decision on the case
s554 i think when you have a mob court it will be very difficult to uphold justice
s555 islamic tourism is a niche market which is growing in volume and significance in challenging times we need to adjust accordingly and take into account the global economic environment
s556 your initiative to push for islamic tourism is an idea whose time has come
s557 it wasnt really fair for him ivan that he didnt play in the glass court before this i could see he was struggling in the glass court he was seeing the ball quite slow
s558 furthermore permatang pauh is anwars home base which his wife pkr president datuk seri dr wan azizah wan ismail won even in 2004 at the height of bns popularity
s559 she has failed the rakyat she has proven she is unfit to serve the people
s560 the people can see for themselves our contributions pr has done nothing they have not helped the malays especially those in the rural areas
s561 everyone has been talking about the discussions and their opinions are varied i fear we may go astray from the original objectives of the talks
s562 that is why i think we should let the leaders of both parties hold formal meetings to discuss matters of importance to umno and pas
s563 we could discuss fundamental issues such as religion and leave politics out
s564 such moves would only lead us to lose focus and force us to talk on old issues that have been a hindrance to closer relations between umno and pas
s565 if all is made known then it would become discussions via the media
s566 there is no basis for the state assembly to demand such a thing
s567 what right do they have to ask the federal government to pay them for the projects
s568 this is all just a political ploy by pakatan rakyat
s569 i am disgusted that tony blair has been invited to malaysia this man to me is a war criminal through instigating the war in iraq he has killed more than former bosnian serb leader radovan karadzic and saddam hussein
s570 saddam has been hanged karadzic was recently arrested but this man goes around the world lecturing on the rule of law
s571 it is great to be back here this is my favourite country the people are friendly and very giving with their smiles
s572 it depends on how often we eat out usually its once or twice every weekend
s573 its better to go to regular sellers they recognise you and will keep the prices reasonable
s574 it further alleged that i had sold out and compromised gerakan the terms sold out and compromised the party essentially means that i have betrayed the party and cannot be trusted with the leadership of gerakan
s575 i just dont know how a book that tells the gerakan story can be interpreted as an attempt to defame someone
s576 we fully support anwar and the party will mobilise its machinery to ensure his victory
s577 i was informed about this development much earlier we will support him all the way
s578 i have lost twice i dont think the party will field me again
s579 i am a fighter i will fight for whoever the party fields as a candidate
s580 i have no problems with ezam former anwar ibrahim aide and pkr youth chief ezam mohd nor contesting the seat i think he will be a good candidate
s581 even the performance of the penang government since the elections is an issue
s582 we call it rezeki harimau we sometimes get a good catch or none at all i will spend more on groceries whenever i get siakap seabass or kerapu garoupa in big quantities
s583 we will keep more of these items before the rainy season my wife knows very well when to stock up on groceries
s584 i have to do it as i want my family to have good meals every day
s585 we have gone through hard times when there was no food at home i dont want my children to beg for food from relatives again
s586 theres nothing much to buy except fresh produce and items like milo and condensed milk
s587 it may raise eyebrows but my husband and children sometimes want to try other types of fish particularly selayang and kembong
s588 these types of fish are cheaper compared to stingray siakap and kerapu that my husband catches its better for him to sell the fish as we can get more money
s589 pas rejects any form of cooperation with umno or bari san nasional at state or federal level we will not be forming any government with them this is no longer an issue
s590 there is nothing secretive any more we can have meetings and the party would be notified of the meetings all this while the party had been informed of the meetings
s591 we want uthayakumar to say that the medicine he had with him appeared in the police search list but it was missing in the detention centres list
s592 he had the medicine when he was moved there we are dealing with a mans life
s593 the court is ready to hear it and so is the senior federal counsel but you are giving all sorts of excuses
s594 if you want this man to be either set free or admitted to a hospital you should proceed now if this was a civil court and you didnt follow the case management directions i would have thrown this case out it is a waste of time to file more affidavits
s595 the idea is to put it all into written submissions because there are too many affidavits
s596 as it is the court has been pushed and pressured just to suit lawyers
s597 i admit that i did it but i did not intend to threaten
s598 this is a serious offence you have taken advantage of a familys grief your action has caused them a lot of worry
s599 the court is not here just to give out punishments it is also to teach lessons
s600 he earns an income of rm450 and supports his four school going siblings he is remorseful of his action and will not do it again
s601 he could be thinking that as the former member of parliament there he would still enjoy good support from voters dr wan azizah took over the seat from anwar and she is now giving way to him
s602 we expected him to contest in permatang pauh although previously anwar said he might stand in bandar tun razak or kulim bandar baharu this shows that he has been misleading the people
s603 i do not think permatang pauh is really a safe seat for anwar taking into consideration all the controversies involving him at present
s604 having a by election involves a lot of work at this time we should be focusing on solving the problems faced by the people and not on pursuing ones personal ambitions
s605 they are treating permatang pauh as a family playground where they can simply pass the baton as and how they like
s606 maybe we should identify a new candidate and not someone who had previously contested there and lost what is important is that he or she must be a party member
s607 umno has gone through various challenges i believe that our machinery would be able to fight against anwar
s608 in the march general election the voters did not reject umno totally what we have to do is to convince them as to why they must support umno and barisan nasional
s609 the general election was just held five months ago barisan nasional would give a strong fight this time around as now the prime minister datuk seri abdullah ahmad badawis leadership is more stable
s610 we in mic are also stronger with our continuous rebuilding and we will give our full support to ensure victory
s611 even if anwar wins it will not make any difference as barisan nasional would still continue to rule the country
s612 but when i read these right finger i always carefully consider the good price because i can always get the s ads and the retailers descriptions
s613 ive lost 30 pounds i really like the new me
s614 my weight loss started off modestly but once i invested in the leanology shakes and capsules the weight started to peel off over the next five months i lost 30 pounds and i have managed to keep it off ever since
s615 i went down to 160 pounds i truly feel terrific
s616 i once thought of myself as lean but now felt heavy
s617 ive lost 27 pounds total im really sold on leanology
s618 i began taking leanology in june 2007 and it only took me three months to achieve my desired weight of 145 pounds a loss of 27 pounds i couldnt believe it i had tried many different weight loss programs in the past but they just would stop working after a point and i couldnt lose any more weight with leanology however i could just keep losing weight im really sold on it
s619 if i could describe the new national defense strategy in one word it would be balance
s620 for the foreseeable future winning the long war against violent extremist movements will be the central objective of the u s
s621 success in iraq and afghanistan is crucial to winning this conflict but it alone will not bring victory
s622 we cannot lose sight of the implications of fighting a long term episodic multi front and multidimensional conflict more complex and diverse than the cold war
s623 we must display a mastery of irregular warfare comparable to that which we possess in conventional combat
s624 the use of force plays a role yet military efforts to capture or kill terrorists are likely to be subordinate to measures to promote local participation in government and economic programs to spur development as well as efforts to understand and address the grievances that often lie at the heart of insurgencies
s625 we cant afford to make any mistakes because that would jeopardise the entire production
s626 i cant imagine having to work on this project without them kar lai wong and chong
s627 we are certainly looking to this match with great hope
s628 i am very proud and honoured to have won this award which would not have been possible without the support of my parents azman hassan and rozita ibrahim and my coach lan wei of china
s629 im surprised to have won this award as it is my first of this kind but i hope to use this to inspire to win my pet events the uneven bars and balance beam at the asean schools championships
s630 my team and i have been working on super tight schedules since the show started there is hardly any room for us to breathe between each episode
s631 honestly styling is one of the toughest jobs around but it doesnt discriminate they love you and your work because you make them beautiful inside and out its not all about hanging out with celebrities or anything like that
s632 we are working under a lot of constraints and stress i constantly remind my team to keep within the dress code as it would determine the success of the show
s633 the backstage normally transforms into a war zone every week we cut snip and even burn some of the costumes to achieve the perfect look for the contestants two weeks ago jimmy had to burn a corset to de stress the lace and mind you the garment looked good after that
s634 oh my it was so funny as i had the half ready hat perpetually placed on my head while i continued altering it in front of the mirror at home the whole night
s635 the participation of these team from the asia pacific region proves that the universitys aim to go global is producing positive results
s636 the winds were medium to strong 12 18 knots and later in the afternoon the waters got rather rough
s637 we sailed for about an hour and a half then decided to head in to avoid damaging the mast in a capsize but not before some radical downwind surfing
s638 when we got onshore we were advised to lash down our boats as the winds were predicted to get stronger overnight
s639 i have not had any problems with my boat but i may have to wait a couple of days since few people will sail with their racing spars in the strong winds predicted for the next two days
s640 our plan tomorrow today will be dependent on what the weather looks like and i suspect the gym and pool are going to be popular for most of the day
s641 no point trying to be a hero before the battle actually begins
s642 we are not happy at all im not sure if muraleedharans job will still be secure after the council meeting as his position as coach will definitely be discussed
s643 we have less than a year to prepare the players for the junior world cup
s644 if new blood should be injected and coaches be replaced then we will go ahead
s645 however we are disappointed with the 102 former internationals for not speaking to us first
s646 we would have taken them seriously and considered their proposals
s647 however we are not holding any grudges as whats done is done and we must now look ahead
s648 we are aware that several parties have received copies of the petition but as for now we are prepared to work with these players regardless what comes next
s649 i heard they are interested to contribute through the grassroots and we welcome their ideas
s650 i cant comment on the players meeting with sultan azlan shah and mazlan we will just wait and see
s651 all reports regarding the coaches and players performance and also documents on the countrys coaching system since 2006 have been given to jegathesan to review
s652 what we are doing is collaborating with the mssm the idea is good as teachers will be more involved in coaching and umpiring
s653 i would love to race against him but i dont think i would be drawn in the same heat as him
s654 the top swimmers will all be grouped into the seeded championship heats and my times wont get me into those heats
s655 i said that about the world championships in melbourne last year and i dont think it is going to be any different in beijing
s656 it will also be the toughest to make the semis the toughest to make the finals and the toughest to win
s657 whether that results in world records all the time or whether the world records will come in the finals i think were going to have to wait and see what happens
s658 it wont be a two horse race between australia and the united states i mean you look at countries like britain japan the french the south africans they perform very solidly
s659 theyve made changes from going to the semis to the finals to lower medals to gold medals theres a major shift in world swimming
s660 i think it is disappointing that someone comes in there and literally steals one of the most exciting moments of the games

s663 our continuing strategic priority is to provide a safe and efficient group of airports whilst pursuing development opportunities which improve the air transport network serving the region
s664 our results for the month demonstrate that we have delivered against these targets and ensured that our airports have continued to play a central role in the economic and social life of the highlands and islands and tayside

s671 this is a great surprise and i have not heard of this happening before
s672 we are disappointed and frustrated with the broadcast by sbs
s673 its no secret that were not satisfied by how the last five races went
s674 i was particularly disappointed after the series montreal magny cours silverstone in each one of these races i had the possibility to win but because of one thing or another things didnt go the right way and i lost
s675 i never let myself be influenced by tension and i wont start now ive just to keep my focus and continue to give as much as possible race after race thats what ive done every time i was in trouble
s676 its still much too early to make any forecasts for the championship considering that the first three drivers are only seven points apart the positions can change in a single race
s677 and its useless to cry over spilled milk we are looking ahead with eight races to go and at the end well do the maths we just passed the halfway point of the season so its important to always gain points
s678 excluding hockenheim i was always in a position to win and i hope success will come soon
s679 the race at hockenheim was the most difficult moment of the season
s680 i was really frustrated and disappointed that i couldnt find the right balance of the car but now were in a much better position
s681 we had a productive test at jerez especially on the second day the team have done some great work in the development of the f2008 and im confident for hungary
s682 i love the circuit and it is a great city budapest so i am looking forward to it very much and i just hope for another good result
s683 i wasnt really quite sure i wanted to come and the reason i came is because my kids would kill me if i didnt
s684 i was playing so bad that it wasnt even fun
s685 i was looking forward to a wonderful day but ive never made as many bogeys as i have the last three months and its driving me crazy
s686 what almost killed umno in the last elections is not the leaders but the supporters who leech on them to further their own personal interests
s687 if the leadership does not listen to us now i can guarantee we will continue to lose seats in the 13th general election
s688 you would be shocked at how many members and leaders did not go out to vote
s689 during the general election a supreme council member will ask whether weve eaten whether we are tired whether we are okay now they tell us what resolutions we can and cannot adopt
s690 there was this resolution by a branch that wanted all umno ministers wives to wear the tudung
s691 that was not passed as the division felt it was not the partys place to force them to do it
s692 but every resolution passed or adopted will be in the annual general meeting report
s693 if your resolution is not accepted you can still request that it be debated at the division meeting and this request will be put to a vote if you get enough votes from all the divisions at the meeting it will be accepted and debated
s694 these days branch members are professionals and they know the partys history and its constitution if i want to be a delegate to the division they will ask me what im about and whom i support for this or that post
s695 if i do not answer correctly i will not be chosen and the person who best represents their aspirations will be and that delegate will go to the division and have a hand in forming the partys direction
s696 the extremely high subsidies by the us have caused serious damage to cotton farmers in developing countries including those in africa and 150 million in china
s697 we believe that the us is not in a position to discuss with developing countries members cotton tariffs until they eliminate their cotton subsidies
s698 one of the most reactionary farm bills in the history of the us
s699 i come from a country where 300 million people live on us 1 a day and 700 million people live on us 2 a day so it is natural for me and in fact incumbent upon me to see that our agricultural interests are not compromised you dont require rocket science to decide between livelihood security and commercial interests
s700 its unfortunate that in a development round we couldnt agree to an issue of livelihood and security
s701 looking for commercial interests and enhancing prosperity rather than looking for content which reduces poverty
s702 i was living in akita at the time i fitted in almost immediately met numerous great jazz musicians and was blown away by their skills
s703 over here the scene is totally different but it is full of promise
s704 they come not just to be entertained but also to learn about the music
s705 so youd have to know your audience or youd end up disappointing them
s706 i wanted to connect with my listeners and before you knew it japan became home to me
s707 i paint for a living and not as a hobby
s708 i called him at the hotel when dylan answered the phone i was tongue tied i eventually composed myself and told him of my intention
s709 he told me to drop it off at the reception and offered complimentary tickets for me and my husband it was awesome
s710 im looking forward to this gig because i love performing in acoustic environments where people enjoy music in its purest form
s711 unlike other jazz events this one is free plus they get to enjoy food and drink in a very relaxed atmosphere
s712 there are 11 sunrise condos near the venue so its within walking distance for residents this explains the good response to the event and why it keeps getting better every year
s713 it is terrible to contemplate how few politicians are hanged
s714 my kind of loyalty was loyalty to ones country not to its institutions or its officeholders
s715 once abolish the god and the government becomes the god
s716 a mans admiration for absolute government is proportionate to the contempt he feels for those around him
s717 the difference between a successful person and others is not a lack of strength not a lack of knowledge but rather in a lack of will
s718 liberals it has been said are generous with other peoples money except when it comes to questions of national survival when they prefer to be generous with other peoples freedom and security

s730 generalmente los lapsus se producen en los momentos en que la persona est en un estado de tensi n con cierta carga emocional
s731 un acto fallido siempre es una producci n del inconsciente en la que se contraponen dos mensajes uno es el mensaje consciente que es el que se quiere dar y el otro es el mensaje inconsciente que se impone involuntariamente
s732 while it is in some respects a sad day for me i do look forward to the next chapter in my life spending more time with wife wendy my daughters and grandchildren
s733 it has been an absolute privilege and honour to serve the wonderful people of this electorate for the past 15 years a responsibility i have never taken for granted
s734 there are some real challenges ahead and it will be important that the people of lyne elect someone who has absolute commitment to the job and the capacity to actually deliver the services and government funding this area needs
s735 you need the backing of a strong team and i have been privileged to have had that from my federal and state colleagues
s736 its also critical to have the absolute support of your family so you can put the people you represent first
s737 parliamentary sittings committee work and other duties of a federal member take you away from home for a good six months of the year
s738 fortunately i have had the full support of wendy and my daughters who have been prepared to sacrifice family time with me so i could do that job effectively
s739 at a recent council meeting representatives from surf lifesaving services australia said 51 people were rescued at the beaches over the past few years
s740 how can a council ignore the principles of competitive neutrality and use general revenue to prop up a poorly performing business unit at the expense of an essential service that saves lives
s741 tourism in this area will be seriously affected by councils decision to not protect their beaches just so it can maintain market share in an area where there is a viable non council alternative
s742 ratepayers should not be punished for councils mismanagement of funds and resources
s743 how many more reports findings and data have to be released saying the same thing before governments sit up and listen
s744 councils are at financial breaking point and are struggling to provide the services and facilities their ratepayers need and deserve
s745 rate pegging is a big problem because it hampers councils ability to set rates according to local needs but a low share of federal taxation revenue skyrocketing election costs and population pressures are also contributing
s746 cost shifting is a continuing issue and the state governments recent planning laws are a classic example they mean a bunch of new panels and systems which councils dont support but will have to fund
s747 if the government supports iparts recommendation to remove councils exemption from payroll tax and increase our contribution to state run fire services ratepayers will again lose
s748 while the infrastructure data used by fiscal star needs to be improved to make the findings for each council more reliable and less alarmist the general conclusions are the same as the independent report into the financial sustainability of local government released in 2006 and various other surveys and findings since
s749 the removal of rate pegging and a greater share of federal taxation are part solutions but the state government also needs to stop cost shifting and start supporting local councils and their ratepayers
s750 councils are committed to their communities and are good at providing for them but are fighting with one hand tied behind their backs
s751 i just wasnt seeing the production and when you get in a situation where you dont see the production and youve got a young group of receivers that are emerging i just felt like it was in our best interests to let him go at this point
s752 youve got to do whats right for the team i guess its the right move for the team hopefully it is

s813 new york state and the united states are experiencing a downturn in the economy that is worse than the energy crisis of 30 years ago that is greater than the economic recession of 40 years ago and may yet be as challenging to the american population as even the great depression this crisis is as undeniable as it is dangerous

s821 since the start of the year vendors have been wary of the potential decrease in demand for mobile phones
s822 that has not stopped vendors from experimenting with and releasing a host of mid range and high end devices with gps touchscreen and multimedia this also goes for hotly contested emerging markets where vendors are introducing phones that offer features in addition to voice telephony reception towards these devices has been warm and as we head into the holiday quarter demand for these and other devices will no doubt increase
s823 smartphones are still seeing growth rates hovering around 40 0 year over year while the rest of the industry is growing at roughly 10 0
s824 however grouping the rest of the handsets into one category is doing the industry no justice the rise of the feature phone has created a battle at the high end of the market with the main difference between smartphone and feature phone being the high level operating system we expect the competition at the high end will help drive growth within the market and help move volume to higher end devices

s848 see what youre dealing with now is karma ha you really are a greek tragedy
s849 the comments on your site really made me feel hopeful and better about the whole situation since i have no experience with cardio stuff
s850 oh because at st davids we dont do heart transplants
s851 well we need to do a heart biopsy and the ones who do that are the doctors who handle transplants
s852 but im also not just going in there until you know the risks so in a transplant patient to do a biopsy of the heart to see if theyre rejecting it isnt a big deal but with you phil the risk is five fold and its by no means a simple little procedure if you want i can go in there and biopsy but when i do that the heart can tear and make a hole which well isnt good see the heart is like steak you know how a flank steak can just tear well essentially im going in there and taking bites out of your heart im telling you all of this because you need to know the risks and some people would rather not have the biopsies theyd rather not know whats going on
s853 because given all you have atrial fibrillation complete stage three heart block and most concerning in all of this a very low velocity and very erratic heart trace something is wrong and very abnormal something bigger is probably going on now usually you have symptoms you come in complaining about your gallbladder or something and we narrow it down to the heart but everything about this situation is well something weve never seen before
s854 if we do the biopsy hopefully well be able to rule out certain heart diseases namely infiltrated cardiomyopothy amyloidosis myocarditis but other things as well the bad thing with doing a biopsy aside from the risks involved with tearing is that sometimes a biopsy yields nothing
s855 is you might not like the results i might tell you that you have something that cannot be cured that even a transplant wont fix and some people dont want that kind of knowledge so they elect not to do the biopsy ill let you two talk it over
s856 stephanie i just have to say it one thing im scared about is that im going to die tomorrow
s857 detailed and transparent barometer of whos voices are most heard in the digital landscape as new channels twitter facebook flick youtube and the like transform how media is created and spread
s858 we believe that new media tools redefine who the online newsmakers and reporters are this is part of the foundation upon which nowpublic is built traditional influence lists are increasingly irrelevant because theyre predicated on outdated factors and metrics did we steal a play from an old media pr conceit lists yes do we want more traffic of course but today there are almost innumerable ways for ones voice to be heard the goal of the mostpublic index is to measure on a completely transparent metric driven basis who is most effectively broadcasting their own personal brand online and who are the emerging players

s877 twenty nine percent say they were raped during their military service they spoke of their continued terror feelings of helplessness and downward spirals many of their lives have taken since
s878 women serving in the u s military today are more likely to be raped by a fellow soldier than killed by enemy fire in iraq
s879 i dont know what youre trying to cover up here but were not going to allow it
s880 the defense department appears to be willfully and blatantly advising dr whitley not to comply with a duly authorized congressional subpoena

s882 i believe that maria would be alive today if the marines had provided a more effective system to protect the victims of sexual assault

s884 maria is dead but there will be many more victims in the future i promise you im here to ask you to do what you can to help change how the military treats victims of crime and to ensure the victims receive the support and protection they need and they deserve
s885 occurrences of sexual assault may be exceeding the rates being reported
s886 at the 14 installations where gao administered its survey 103 service members indicated that they had been sexually assaulted within the preceding 12 months of these 52 service members indicated that they did not report the sexual assault
s887 left unchecked these challenges can discourage or prevent some service members from using the programs when needed

s899 o tribunal constitucional pronunciou se pela inconstitucionalidade de v rias normas do decreto que aprovou a revis o do estatuto pol tico administrativo dos a ores nesse sentido irei devolver nos termos da lei o respectivo diploma assembleia da rep blica
s900 devo no entanto comunicar aos portugueses que outras normas me suscitam s rias reservas de natureza pol tico institucional
s901 trata se acima de tudo da norma relativa dissolu o da assembleia legislativa dos a ores que inovando em rela o ao estatuto em vigor e em rela o ao estatuto da madeira restringe o exerc cio das compet ncias pol ticas do presidente da rep blica pondo em causa o equil brio e a configura o de poderes do nosso sistema pol tico previsto na constitui o
s902 em devido tempo alertei v rios dirigentes pol ticos para esta quest o
s903 nos termos da constitui o a assembleia legislativa regional pode ser dissolvida pelo presidente da rep blica ouvidos o conselho de estado e os partidos nela representados
s904 o diploma em causa pretende agora consagrar o dever adicional de o presidente da rep blica ouvir tamb m a assembleia legislativa os seus grupos e representa es parlamentares e o presidente do governo regional
s905 quer isto dizer que o presidente da rep blica estaria sujeito a mais deveres de audi o e consulta no que toca dissolu o da assembleia regional dos a ores do que os previstos para a dissolu o da assembleia da rep blica
s906 no caso da assembleia da rep blica o presidente da rep blica nos termos constitucionais n o precisa de ouvir a assembleia da rep blica nem o primeiro ministro mas no caso da assembleia legislativa dos a ores teria de ouvir a pr pria assembleia legislativa regional e o presidente do governo regional
s907 a audi o aut noma do presidente do governo regional tanto mais incompreens vel quanto ele tem assento no conselho de estado e a ouvido pelo presidente da rep blica
s908 o mesmo se pode dizer relativamente audi o aut noma da assembleia legislativa e dos seus grupos parlamentares porquanto nos termos constitucionais o presidente da rep blica j ouve os partidos nela representados
s909 entendo que perigoso para o princ pio fundamental da separa o e interdepend ncia de poderes que alicer a o nosso sistema pol tico aceitar o precedente que poderia ser invocado no futuro de por lei ordin ria como o caso do estatuto pol tico administrativo dos a ores se vir a impor obriga es e limites s compet ncias dos rg os de soberania que n o sejam expressamente autorizados pela constitui o da rep blica
s910 semelhante pr tica desfiguraria o equil brio de poderes tal como este tem existido e afectaria o normal funcionamento das institui es da rep blica por isso que considero ser meu dever alertar os portugueses
s911 devo igualmente chamar a aten o para um outro ponto conexo com o anterior
s912 no passado dia 10 deste m s foi publicada uma lei da assembleia da rep blica sobre o estatuto do representante da rep blica nas regi es aut nomas no qual se estipula tal como consta da constitui o que o representante nomeado e exonerado pelo presidente da rep blica ouvido o governo
s913 sobre exactamente o mesmo assunto o decreto da assembleia da rep blica que aprova o novo estatuto dos a ores acrescenta a obriga o do presidente da rep blica ouvir tamb m a assembleia legislativa da regi o
s914 n o se questiona a audi o da assembleia regional na pessoa do seu presidente foi isso que fiz no in cio do meu mandato quando nomeei os representantes da rep blica para os a ores e para a madeira pr tica que ali s segui quando desempenhei as fun es de primeiro ministro e que tenciono manter como presidente da rep blica
s915 mas se aquela audi o tiver por objecto o pr prio rg o colegial podem emergir consequ ncias negativas no processo de designa o do representante
s916 por um lado porque pode colocar o presidente da rep blica no centro de um debate parlamentar regional e por outro porque pode fragilizar politicamente o representante da rep blica e dificultar a escolha de uma personalidade com perfil adequado
s917 considero ainda que merecem repondera o outras normas inovadoras constantes do estatuto
s918 por um lado o procedimento de audi o qualificada que pelas vincula es que cria para os rg os de soberania envolvidos restringe os seus poderes de decis o ultrapassando em muito a regulamenta o do simples direito de audi o previsto na constitui o
s919 por outro lado a limita o dos poderes de revis o do estatuto pela assembleia da rep blica s normas que tenham sido objecto da iniciativa da assembleia legislativa a oriana implica restri es excessivas ao poder de iniciativa legislativa superveniente dos deputados do parlamento nacional
s920 face incerteza que caracteriza os tempos modernos a possibilidade de petrifica o de normas jur dicas constantes do estatuto ao ponto de eternizar a sua vig ncia deve ser examinada com todo o cuidado
s921 a altera o do estatuto pol tico administrativo dos a ores visa concretizar o modelo avan ado de autonomia resultante da revis o constitucional de 2004 mas indispens vel que essa altera o se harmonize com a separa o de poderes e as compet ncias dos rg os de soberania consagrados na constitui o da rep blica portuguesa

s951 there are around 41 fewer first time buyers now than at the same time last year
s952 the nationwide data indicate that there is ongoing major downward pressure on house prices from extremely weak market activity stretched buyer affordability and tight lending conditions it seems odds on that house prices will continue to head rapidly south given that the bank of england reported extremely low mortgage approvals for house purchases in june while latest survey evidence shows that house sales are depressed buyer interest is weak it is taking longer to sell a house and sellers are achieving a falling percentage of their asking price
s953 its clear that gordon brown failed to prepare our economy during his 10 years at the treasury and now hard pressed families are paying the price
s954 this correction in house prices is happening because the government allowed the market to get hopelessly out of control
s955 interest rate cuts are clearly not on the agenda in the near term
s956 which would clearly be very bad news for the housing market
s957 affected by this regrettable situation in particular to those who had received an inaccurate diagnosis
s958 i can confirm that 17 patients were initially informed incorrectly that they did not have a malignancy such as cancer however we must emphasise that a number of these patients would have undergone precautionary treatment anyway or been subject to ongoing clinical review
s959 furthermore we can now give absolute assurance that all patients are now following the correct course of treatment
s960 our highest priority throughout has been the care and wellbeing of our patients and we have acted as quickly as possible to make sure that the review was carried out thoroughly and effectively
s961 the patients involved have generally appreciated the efforts we have made to investigate this situation and to recheck individually their samples diagnosis and treatment and i thank them all for their patience and understanding no patients that we have been able to identify have died as a result of a misdiagnosis
s962 where necessary those patients have had their treatment amended we would like to reassure patients that individual details will not be made public
s963 clearly everyone affected will be concerned that not having received the appropriate treatment at the appropriate time has adversely affected their chances of recovery or worsened their prognosis
s964 this is not the first time that a large group of people have been harmed by what appears to have involved the poor judgment of a histopathologist which is why a careful multi disciplinary approach to diagnosis and assessment of treatment modality is so important
s965 an episode such as this demands an independent inquiry into what went wrong so that lessons can be learned across the health service
s966 the spiritual leadership of a global communion of independent and autonomous provinces should not be reduced to one man appointed by a secular government
s967 unless we reach some kind of resolution in the next 48 hours this whole thing will have been an expensive waste of time
s968 the devil may be in the detail of the implementation report to be published in the autumn
s969 lack of commitment from nhs management at all levels has impeded progress in implementing informatics support for patient care
s970 if we were to criticise it would be that there is little recognition or emphasis on building from experience as a profession we have extensive experience on the issues and problems of health informatics we hope this will be used too much emphasis on central development sometimes ignores this fund of knowledge
s971 ticket sales have been brisk and our inventory is dwindling by the day

s973 there are matters which have arisen which would have caused anybody very considerable concern
s974 the evidence has demonstrated that the practice of beasting which clearly falls outside appropriate military discipline was going on in these barracks openly and must have been known to senior officers
s975 many will have found it unpalatable that the order from captain davis to bring this man to them hot and sweaty was an order that the defendants found themselves having to comply with this sort of activity should not be condoned and mustnt be allowed to happen again and this lesson must be clearly relayed to those in charge
s976 the conclusion of the trial allows the royal military police now to conduct a full investigation into his death
s977 this will examine whether there were any breaches of military law a decision can then be made on further action i am unable to comment until this investigation concludes
